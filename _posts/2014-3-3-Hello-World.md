title: Energy from Sunlight
---

Almost all energy originally comes from sunlight. Fossil fuels were once plants grown by photosyntesis. Wind is caused by differential heating of the earth's surface by the sun. Solar energy is direct coversion from sunlight. Two exceptions are
geothermal energy due to radioactive decay in the earth' crust or mantle. Tidal power comes from varying gravitational forces from the moon and to a lesser amount, from the sun.
